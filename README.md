# 100DaysOfCode

### My 100 days of code in "this" repo includes 40+ projects with JS, CSS and HTML.

 *MOST of the projects will have pre-made css and boilerplate html as it's focused on JS* (atleast P 1-15)

#### Project ideas:
*https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/*

### Specific ideas:
- Using dribble - recreate "a" site in Css.
- Pull a free API (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) & display it on a site :)
-

## Day 5. (11.Nov)

**Starting Menu**
- Created a variant of the final JS code. *Commented out*
- Implementing the other as well (Dynamically adding additional category)
- Naming for the different files are simple "Index1.html and app1.js" are the original static solution. Where as index.html and app.js is the dynamic one. By dynamic i mean: If you add another category it pops up as an option :)
