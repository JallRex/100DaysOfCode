# 100DaysOfCode

### My 100 days of code in "this" repo includes 40+ projects with JS, CSS and HTML.

 *MOST of the projects will have pre-made css and boilerplate html as it's focused on JS* (atleast P 1-15)

#### Project ideas:
*https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/*

### Specific ideas:
- Using dribble - recreate "a" site in Css.
- Pull a free API (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) & display it on a site :)
-

## Day 5. (11.Nov)

**Starting Menu**
- Created a variant of the final JS code. *Commented out*
- Implementing the other as well (Dynamically adding additional category)
- Naming for the different files are simple "Index1.html and app1.js" are the original static solution. Where as index.html and app.js is the dynamic one. By dynamic i mean: If you add another category it pops up as an option :)

**Started Video project**
- Added files needed. 
- Planned for a short project today. (Video background.) In theory it should be simple.

**Finished Video project**

## Day 7. (13.Nov)
**Started Scroll/Nav project.**

- added files and structure
- working on dynamically updating height of navbar so that more or less links can be added.
- added scroll functions to navigate the site better. made nav menu flexible and made sure that both smaller and bigger screens still navigate to the correct height on the site.
- added auto close nav-menu on small devices when scrolling :)

**Finished Scroll/Nav project**


## Day 8. (14.nov)

**Started tabs project**

- This was a tricky project. I was unable to get it working even though I compared the files exactly. It seems that some bugs were introduced, so after adjusting for a while I ended up using the files from the final project to compare against.

**Finished project tabs**
