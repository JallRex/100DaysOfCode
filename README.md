# 100DaysOfCode

### My 100 days of code in "this" repo includes 40+ projects with JS, CSS and HTML.

 *MOST of the projects will have pre-made css and boilerplate html as it's focused on JS* (atleast P 1-15)

#### Project ideas:
*https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/*

### Specific ideas:
- Using dribble - recreate "a" site in Css.
- Pull a free API (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) & display it on a site :)
